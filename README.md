The internet is still a wild west, rife with mis-information and predators. The current system of writing "callout posts" and "cancelling" figures is antiquated. There's an excess of information and false information to keep facts sorted out.

Prairie Watchdog aims to address these issues by collecting and filtering these wrongdoings into one reliable source-of-truth. You'll be alerted when visiting sites with flagged activity (i.e. sites that steal and resell artwork without permission) or when visiting individual social media users.

This is the monorepo for the two parts that make up Prairie Watchdog:
1) A website, prairiewatch.dog, and database storing online misdemeanors
2) A chrome extension that flags pages with a watchdog ranking.

**The work in this repo is still heavily work-in-progress.** Stay tuned for updates as this repo gets set up for proper open source collaboration.
