# Sexual Assault and Rape

The definitions for the different degrees of sexual assault detailed here follow closely with current defitions of US law. RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) states, "The term sexual assault refers to sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim. Sexual assault can take many different forms, but one thing remains the same: it’s never the victim’s fault."[^1] "Rape is a form of sexual assault [that] specifically include[s] sexual penetration without consent."[^1]

Sexual assault offenses relating to persons under 16 fall under the `Pedophilia` offense class.
