    summary: |
      User rudletoodle on Toyhouse (Crona on Discord in the screenshots) shared their interactions with ArcSanity. The interactions supposedly started based on prior behaviors outlined in a [PSA written by user crunchdad on Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/~bulletins/171427.-beware-of-a-possible-character-thief-). The PSA details, "[ArcSanity is] a blatant liar and racist (pretended to be asian and guilt tripped and pretended to be other people to try and get an myo after we banned them) and is now in the dms threatening my staff that theyre going to steal characters."

      The threatening messages escalated into death threats:

      On October 17th at 8am PDT, ArcSanity posted [a Toyhouse bulletin](https://arcsanity.tumblr.com/post/632272973792952320/sarcastic-joke), [a Tumblr post](https://arcsanity.tumblr.com/post/632272973792952320/sarcastic-joke) [(Archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20201018034441/https://arcsanity.tumblr.com/post/632272973792952320/sarcastic-joke), and [a project on Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/437590087/) with the same text titled, "Sarcastic joke". They mock the response to their behaviors, writing "oh no ArcSanity said death threats online!! Letâ€™s cancel them" for example.

      On October 17th at 7pm PDT, ArcSanity responded on their alt Toyhouse account CallMeObsequious with [a post titled "I am truly sorry"](https://toyhou.se/~bulletins/175916.i-am-truly-sorry). In it, they start off by stating, "Idek what this current drama is about". Later in the post, they state, "I'm sorry for trolling. I'm sorry for the death threats. I'm sorry for tracing twice. I'm sorry for being a whiny bitch. I was just being a hormone-filled teenager who's too stressed."

      On October 17th at 8:40pm PDT, ArcSanity made a duplicate bulletin post of the "I am truly sorry" text on their main ArcSanity toyhouse account. They also added additional text at the bottom, "Bye. I apologized. I owned up to my mistakes. Yet you push on. Quit. Responding.", and so on.
