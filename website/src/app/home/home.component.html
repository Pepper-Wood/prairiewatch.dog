  <p>Prairie dogs are highly social and co-operate in large groups to share food and protect their burrow. As primary consumers in the food chain, they are sought after by much larger, dangerous prey. They act together to ensure each others' safety. One or more individual prairie dogs act as a sentinel keeping watch for danger and send out warning calls while the rest of the group stays in their burrows for safety.</p>
  <p>The motif of the prairie dog carries throughout this project. By tracking and tagging people who abuse their power and act without accountability, we can more clearly avoid their platforms and dimish that power. <b>The goal is not to attack offenders but for us as potential victims to be warned and avoid.</b></p>
