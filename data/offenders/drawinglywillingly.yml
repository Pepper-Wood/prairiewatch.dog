    summary: |
      Pararipi reveals that they are Prismaneko / Prisma-neko. They explain that their daughter suddenly required surgery on her ear that would cost 5000-8000 USD. "I took a LOAD of commissions" and estimate this to be around 50. "I lost track super easily."

      Despite the surgery, Pararipi explains her daughter's ears didn't recover and resulted in "los[ing] hope in my art. [...] I just COULDN'T." Until finally, "Of course, I took the cheap way. Run away from the account."

      The Pararipi account was opened so Prisma / Pararipi could raise money through adoptables. They ask those prior commissions to reach out with what they are owed so Pararipi can resume the commissions that were promised by Prisma-Neko.
