## What is an MLM?
The idea behind MLMs is that people pay to become distributors of a product. These can be physical products or services. The company is structured so that the people above (the person who recruited or signed up the new distributor, the people above them, ad infinitum) get a percentage of whatever the distributor sells. The new distributor is encouraged not only to sell the product, but to sign up other people below them so that they can make even more money. courtesy [https://www.reddit.com/u/copacetic1515]

## What is a "Hun"?
People who shill products/services for an MLM. The sellers have a tendency to frequently use the word "hun" when initiating a sales pitch. Ex: “Hey hun ❤️❤️ I see your aunt is dying 😱😱 anyway hun 😊💁‍♀️ wanna buy my oils it’s good for stress 😍😘😘”. courtesy (u/fiestaspongebob)[https://www.reddit.com/u/fiestaspongebob]
