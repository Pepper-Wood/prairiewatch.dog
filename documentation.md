# Types of Sources Not Permitted
### Lawsuits or Court Rulings
Lawsuits are not permitted as a source for evidence of an offense taking place due to many factors that may result in an incorrect conclusion:
- Cases may be closed due to lack of ability to fund lawyers
- The laws used to determine an outcome may be immoral or unjust

Instead, investigate the credibility of the plaintiff's arguments and submit separate which ones are properly sourced.
