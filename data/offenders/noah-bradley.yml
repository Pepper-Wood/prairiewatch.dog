    summary: >
      Noah Bradley posted a tweet featuring an apology and an admittance to past behaviors. "I was terrible to women." "I preyed on them. I ceaselessly hit on them. I pressured them into sex. I got too drunk and did all manner of dumb things. Yes, I was one of those shitty, creepy sexual predators you hear about." The confession "pressured them into sex" specifically admits to rape.
