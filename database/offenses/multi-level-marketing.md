# Multi-Level Marketing

Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) is a marketing strategy employed by companies where employees (or "distributors") earn money via two revenue streams:
- by **selling the MLM’s products** yourself to “retail” customers who are not involved in the MLM[^1]
- by **recruiting new distributors** and earning commissions based on what they buy and their sales to retail customers.[^1]

Some MLMs are illegal Pyramid Schemes, where the majority of revenue is derived from the second of the aforementioned streams: through recruiting new distributors. "If the MLM is not a pyramid scheme, it will pay you based on your sales to retail customers, without having to recruit new distributors."[^1]

Other common qualities of an MLM, though these do not fall under offenses:
- The product is sub-par but priced high
- The company requires new distributors to purchase a starter kit to buy into the company
- Distributors are encouraged to reach out to their friends and family for sales and recruitment
- Distributors may purport to be "small business owners" and are encouraged to "be their own boss".

## Offense Categories

### A. The company's income disclosure information indicates the majority of revenue for distributors comes from recruitment.
If the majority of distributors within a company or the company itself make more than 50% of their profits through recruitment over selling product.

### B. The company's income disclosure information indicates majority of distributors do not turn a profit.

### C. The company's ranking system requires a set number of people to be recruited in routine timeframes.
If rising up the "corporate ladder" requires hitting sale marks on a monthly or routine basis, and those sale marks are based on recruiting new distributors.

### D. The individual is a high-ranking member of a Multi-Level Marketing company.
